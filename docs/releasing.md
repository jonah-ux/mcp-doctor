# Releasing

Run tests, build wheel and sdist, install both in fresh environments, run the demo, verify the
package version and `mcp-doctor --version`, create an annotated tag through the approved repository
route, publish wheel/source/checksum assets, then verify a fresh download.

## Automated prerelease path

The reviewed `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs only for an annotated semantic-version tag such as
`v0.1.0` (or the repository's current version). It builds the wheel and source archive, writes
`SHA256SUMS`, and creates a GitHub prerelease with those assets. A normal push to `main` does not
publish anything. Keep the release deliberate: complete the checks above, review the exact commit,
then push the approved tag through the repository's governed route and verify the downloaded assets.
